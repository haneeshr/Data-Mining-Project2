Running Density based clustering:

Note: Make sure the necessary input files are placed in this folder before running the program.

1. Invoke the program as follows - python3 DBscan.py <filename> <eps-value> <minpoints>

2. The program will output the jaccard and clusters are plotted using PCA, which can be visualized for checking the performance of the algorithm.


   Examples:
   python3 DBScan.py cho.txt 1.03 4
